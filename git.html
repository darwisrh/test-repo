         <h3>Eminem ft. Rihanna - Love The Way You Lie</h3>
         <p>Eminem's first verse</p>
         <p>
            I can't tell you what it really is
            I can only tell you what it feels like
            And right now there's steel knife in my windpipe
            I can't breathe but i still fight, while i can fight
            As long as the wrong feels right, it's like i'm in flight
            High off of love, drunk from her hate
            It's like i'm huffing pain, and i love her the more i suffer
            I suffocate, and right before i'm 'bout to drown
            She resuscitates me, she fuckin' hates me
            And i love it, "wait
            where you going?", "i'm leaving you"
            "No you ain't, come back", we running right back, here we go again
            It's so insane, cause when it's going good it's going great
            I'm superman without wings at his back, she's Lois Lane
            But when it's bad it's awful
            I fell soo ashamed, i snapped "Who's that dude?"
            "I don't eve know his name", i laid hands on here
            I'll never stoop so low again, i guess i don't know my own strength
